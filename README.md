# Civvy Sim

_This was made for my friend's TTRPG so this likely won't work for you unless you adopt the same schema. It could make a good reference implementation though._

You can use the tool [here](https://lokej-h.github.io/civvy-roller/).

## TODO

- [X] add advantage (thanks @Mpyatt)
- [X] add vehicles
- [X] fix snake eye check (thanks @Mpyatt)
